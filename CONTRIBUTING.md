# 🤝 Contributing to FinSight AI

Welcome to the **Intelligence Syndicate**. We are excited you're interested in helping us engineer the future of financial literacy for Hackonomics 2026.

## 🏗 Coding Standards

To maintain the high-fidelity nature of FinSight AI, we adhere to strict standards:

- **Aesthetics First**: Every component must look professional. Use Tailwind's spacing scale and custom "glass" effects.
- **TypeScript**: No `any`. Use strict typing for all financial data structures.
- **Performance**: Minimize AI calls where deterministic math can suffice. Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for heavy charts.
- **Accessibility**: Use ARIA labels and ensure high contrast for financial metrics.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Fork the Repo**: Ensure you are working on the latest `main` branch.
2. **Feature Branch**: Create a branch with a prefix (e.g., `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`).
3. **Clean Code**: Run linting and ensure no console logs are left in production components.
4. **Pull Request**: Provide a clear description of the "Economic Value" your change adds to the project.

## 💡 Mission Alignment

When contributing, ask yourself:
- Does this make a complex concept easier to understand?
- Does this help a user make a better financial decision?
- Is the AI interaction seamless and "magical"?

## 🛠 Feature Wishlist
- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Allowing two AI profiles to debate a strategy.
- **Advanced Bond Laddering**: Detailed visualizations for treasury strategies.
- **Localized Tax Laws**: Extending the Tax Architect to international jurisdictions.
